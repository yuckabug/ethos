# Yuckabug Ethos

## Open Source

We're committed to building open source software. All our projects are released under permissive licenses that
encourage collaboration, scrutiny, and reuse.

## Our Mission

We are a team of developers passionate about building **simple**, **minimal**, and **robust** software.

Software is built from the perspective of providing a simple experience, without unnecessary features. If we can't
justify adding a feature, we don't add it.

## Technology-Agnostic

We're technology-agnostic. We're not tied to any one technology stack, and we're not afraid to try new things. We
select the right tool for each job, prioritizing proven, maintainable technologies that align with our core principles.

## Creating New Software Ideas

When developing new software:

- Identify a clear problem to solve
- Focus on solving that problem well with minimal complexity
- Start with a minimal viable product (MVP)
- Ensure core functionality works flawlessly before expanding
- Question every feature: "Does this serve our users' core needs?"
- Favor intuitive designs that require minimal documentation

## Enhancing Existing Software

When adding functionality to existing projects:

- New features must demonstrably improve user experience
- Avoid feature creep - remove a feature if adding a new one
- Refactor before adding complexity
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Performance and reliability come before new capabilities
- Consider maintenance burden of each addition

## Ideal Software Characteristics

Our software should be:

- **Focused**: Solves specific problems without scope creep
- **Reliable**: Works consistently in all supported environments
- **Maintainable**: Easy to understand, modify, and debug
- **Efficient**: Uses resources responsibly
- **Accessible**: Usable by people with diverse needs
- **Secure**: Protects user data and privacy by design
- **Documented**: Includes clear, concise documentation
- **Tested**: Covered by comprehensive automated tests

## Development Practices

- Less is more
- Embrace iterative development
- Write clean, readable code
- Use continuous integration
- Practice peer review
- Automate testing and deployment
- Document design decisions

## User Experience Principles

- Respect users' time and attention
- Provide sensible defaults
- Design for discoverability, not complexity
- Value consistency over novelty
- Optimize for the common case
